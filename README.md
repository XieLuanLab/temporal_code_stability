# Fitting Temporal Components From Spiking Time Course 

## 1. Installation
-	Install MATLAB2023b (tested on linux OS) following official MATLAB instructions
-	Install time ~ 1hr

## 2.1 Demo A
-	Run main.m
-	This code demonstrates fitting stimulus-coding temporal components from spiking time course, a method central to the claim in the manuscript. It reproduces Fig. 4a-d using data from one representative neuron in response to 16 drifting gratings of different directions, 50 trials per day, for 15 consecutive days. It loads the variable "VS_Store," which is a 1x15 cell. Each cell contains 50 trials x 16 classes x 520 time bins (1 ms) after stimulus onsets, with 0 meaning no spike and 1 meaning a spike discovered in that bin. It further loads source data to produce rest of the Fig 4. 
-	Expected output: complete Fig4
-	run time ~ 3 min
